# Ask:Answer

A student/teacher platform which allows students to message teachers with questions and/or request office hours. The teacher can view messages, respond to messages, and schedule office hours. It is built with a React frontend and Rails backend.

## How It Works

A user can login as a student or teacher. A student is able to view all of their classes, create new messages, view old messages, view teacher responses, and acknowledge teacher responses. A teacher is able to view all their classes, view student messages, respond to student messages, schedule office hours, view previous responses, and view student acknowledgements. 

## Built Using?

Ask:Answer was built with a Rails backend which handles user authentication as well as student and teacher data and information. The frontend is built with React which handles neatly displaying the classes, requests, and responses for the teacher and student users.
